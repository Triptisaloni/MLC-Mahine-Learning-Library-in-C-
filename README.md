1.MLC++ : A Machine Learning Library in C++


Summary: 


MLC++ 

is a library of C++ classes and tools for supervised machine learning. It is used to create utilities for supervised machine learning.

Main Goal

To implement and test new ideas of learning algorithms.
To generate performance data and compare different algorithms on this basis
To graphically display the learned concept

Problems with current Methodology

Comparison is difficult
Implementing Algorithms is difficult
Experiments are hard to perform again
